# Encrypted secrets placeholder
# This directory stores age-encrypted secrets that are safe to commit to git.
# 
# Files stored here:
# - init.json.age: OpenBao initialization data (unseal keys and root token)
# - root-ca.pem.age: Root CA certificate (encrypted)
#
# To decrypt, you need the age.key file which should be stored securely
# and NEVER committed to git.
